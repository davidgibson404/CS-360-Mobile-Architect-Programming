# CS-360-Mobile-Architect-Programming

The Weight Tracker app was developed to address the needs of individuals who are actively monitoring their weight for health or fitness goals. The primary requirement was to create a simple yet effective tool that allows users to log their daily weight entries, view historical data, and track their progress over time. The app was designed with user-centered principles in mind, ensuring that the interface is intuitive and easy to navigate. Key screens include a login screen for secure access, a main dashboard where users can view and manage their weight entries, and an SMS notification feature to remind users to log their weight regularly. These features were thoughtfully designed to keep the user’s experience at the forefront, ensuring that the app is not only functional but also engaging and supportive of their goals.

In terms of development, the coding process was approached systematically, starting with a solid understanding of the app’s architecture and the needs it was meant to address. I employed modular programming techniques, ensuring that each component of the app was well-defined and could be tested independently. This approach made it easier to manage the complexity of the app and allowed for more efficient troubleshooting. Testing was an integral part of the development process; Though initial testing was focused on API level 35. This process was crucial in identifying and resolving bugs, ensuring that the app performs reliably across different environments. Testing also revealed the importance of backward compatibility, prompting plans for further testing on older Android versions.

Throughout the development process, there were several challenges that required innovative solutions. For instance, ensuring that the app’s user interface was responsive across different screen sizes required careful consideration of layout design and testing on multiple devices. The aspect of the app I am most proud of is the secure login and user management system, where I successfully demonstrated my knowledge of handling user data securely while maintaining an intuitive and seamless user experience.
